Complete a game similiar to that of last exercise. use arrays, functions, modules

Create rooms, monsters, traps etc.

Do not use a debugger

Use while-loop only to loop forever and that means probably never. This applies mostly to Ruby; other languages are different.

Use a for-loop for all other kinds of looping, especially if there is a fixed or limited numbre of things to loop over.
