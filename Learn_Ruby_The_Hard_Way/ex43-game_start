Scene is used instead of room because the word room would make it more 
confusing and odd. 

* Map
* Engine
* Scene
  * Death
  * Central Corridor
  * Laser Weapon Armory
  * The Bridge
  * Escape Pod

Then go through and figure out what actions are needed on each thing
based on verbs in the description. For example im going to need a 
way to "run" the eniin, "get to the next scene", from the map, get the
"opening scene" and "enter" a scene. So I add it like this.

* Map
	- next_scene
	- opening_scene
* Engine
	- play
* Scene
	- enter
	* Death
	* Central Corridor
	* Laser weapon Armory
	* The Bridge
	* Escape Pod

I just put -enter under Scene since I know that all scenes under it will
inherit it and hat to override it later.
